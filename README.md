## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

  I've studied html and css primarily when i was 13 years old, stayed without studying a lot of time, until this year. I'm studying again and this is my first project, i'm very happy with the results. I remembered and learned new things about those languages and what i learned more is how works to make responsive pages, the units to do layouts fixed and fluid and other properties of this theme.

### Continued development
  
  The solution is very similar to the orignal, but i think that the way i made is not the best way. To my next projects i will focus on use other unitys of CSS, to make responsive pages more easy and proportional.
